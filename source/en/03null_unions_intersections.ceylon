 special syntactic abbreviation "String?".

 EXERCISE
 
 We usually use the "exists" operator instead

 sugar!
 
 Next, to make the code a little more compact,
 change the code to use this form of the if

 the types Character and the type Integer are

 Well, the type Nothing indicates, in practice,
 that a invocation of a function or evaluation

 It might seem that Nothing isn't very useful 
 for anything, but it helps a lot when defining

 There's a special trick we can do with union
 types that help us give functions like max()
 and min() the correct type.
 
 The problem is that when we have "zero or 
 more things", max() can return null. But when 
 we have "one or more" things, it can't. And 
 when we have exactly zero things, max() 
 always returns null. How can we capture this
 within the type system?

 Check out the definitions of max() and

 The solution involves Nothing ;-)
