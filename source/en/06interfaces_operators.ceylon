/*
 
 An interface defines a contract that can be 
 satisfied by a class. Interfaces may have formal
 members, or even concrete members:
 
 - methods,
 - getters and setters, and
 - member classes.
 
 But an interface may not:
 
 - have an attribute that holds a reference to a 
   value, or
 - define initialization logic.
 
 Thus, we say that interfaces are stateless. This
 means that "diamond" inheritance is unproblematic
 in Ceylon.
